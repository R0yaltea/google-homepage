A bried introduction for what the project is and what skills you have demonstrated once completed. 
Planning to use this a reflection document once I have finished, to summarize my learning. 

This was my first project, hopfully the one that would captivate me to such an extreme that I had no option but to pursue a future in programing, and it did, sorta. I can't say for sure if I am hooked or not but I can with confidence say that I want to continue learning. This project helped to familiarize me with the basics of HTML5 and CSS. I was able to after some carful guidance from generous Stackoverflow users implement some hover conditions. Looking forward to continuing my education from here.
